# Final Project by Derek (002)
# This project will try to conduct sentimental analysis on online forum comments.
# The purpose of this project is for personal practice and evaluating applicability for future projects.
# One application example is exploring relationship between Bitcoin price and Influencer activities 
# For the above example, the key task is to accurately interpret netizens' reactions, position or negative, to the post.
# In this project, I will import a database of a small sample of online forum comments
# Then, I will try to parse it, and interpret it.
# The goal is for the program to give a verdict of whether the post is Positive, Neutral or Negative.
# The final part of the project is to give a nice visualization of the interpretation.
